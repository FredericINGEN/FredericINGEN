### 🖖 Hi, I'm Frederic.

I’m a builder and open-source advocate on a mission to bring true digital sovereignty to the industrial and medical sectors. For me, sovereignty isn't just a buzzword or a box to check, it's a core conviction. I want to build tools that give power back to the users/Industries, rather than trapping them in walled gardens and SaaS dependencies.

### 🛰️ What I'm currently exploring

Right now, I'm operating at the intersection of complex process data and semantic reasoning. I'm building "Logic Cells"—autonomous, offline-capable knowledge systems designed for SMEs. 

Most of my day-to-day revolves around **Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM)** and ML:

* ⚗️ **Data Alchemy:** Developing ways to extract structured, meaningful data out of messy, real-world industrial machine logs and medical records.
* 👁️‍🗨️ **Semantic Reasoning:** Moving way beyond flat event logs. I use OCPM and semantic databases to map complex, multi-object relationships in manufacturing (at least i am trying ;)).
* 🏰 **Autonomy by Design:** Ensuring that the logic we build can run completely independent of centralized cloud infrastructure.

### ☕ Beyond the Code

I believe the best connections happen when we talk about more than just syntax. When I'm not writing Rust or querying graphs, you can probably find me:
* Tinkering with my **Homelab** and exploring self-hosted, local-first architectures.
* 📖 *(Hier kannst du ein Hobby einfügen, z.B. Reading about decentralized tech, bouldering, brewing way too much coffee, etc.)*

### 📡 Let's Connect

I am always looking for like-minded people who refuse to just hand over the digital landscape to big tech. If you want to collaborate, swap ideas about OCPM and Rust, or just chat about the future of independent software—reach out!
